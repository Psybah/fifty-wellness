# Questions (06/08/2025)

- What type of products will be in the Marketplace? (This will influence the marketplace design.)
- The blog posts in the design have proper headings and sub-headings; however, what is being sent doesn’t. Is this how the structure of the blog is meant to be?
- Does this MVP require a sophisticated system to handle a large influx of users (with more infrastructural & development cost), or a quick MVP that works as expected (with extra effort to scale later)?
- Need more clarification on the unique services we are offering to businesses (B2B), especially those not offered to individuals.
- How are businesses onboarded on the platform? Should employees have a special section on the page?
